 Data Drive Security Insights

Data Drive Security Insights is a machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting the nature and impact of cybersecurity breaches. Using breach data, this project classifies breach methods and predicts the estimated impact (e.g., number of records lost), helping inform proactive data protection strategies.

Project Objectives

- Classify: The breach method (e.g., Hacking, Phishing, Lost Device).
- Predict: Breach impact using regression models (e.g., records affected).
- Visualize: breach trends, methods, and impacts.
- Support:  data-driven security insights for decision-makers.
